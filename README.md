## What is PowerShell ?

PowerShell is an object **oriented programmation language** and a shell interpreter developped in C#.

PowersShell is based on **.NET Framework**. Since the version **7.0** PowerShell can be installed and used on other OS such as Linux, Mac.

There is major differences since PowerShell Core (7.0) and PowerShell (5.1) as the 7.0 version is based on an higher .NET Framework version.

The main strenghts of PowerShell are his capabilities to interact easily with objects and the simplicity of usage of the commands that PowerShell provide named cmdlets.

As PowerShell is a programmation language, we are able to create and automate many actions. The extension of a script file is *.ps1*
